Bring your existing phones or purchase new phones that get here prepared for calling. Any business VOIP system must offer you basic calling functions as part of the service, such as a voicemail system for each user and caller ID for inbound calls. The features of a PBX phone system are fundamental compared to VoIP, however you'll still have the ability to collaborate incoming and outbound calls, make call transfers, and handle voicemail and extensions.</p>

Xblue's systems are hybrids, supporting both standard telephone company lines and internet-based VoIP lines. For example, an auto attendant informs customers which departments to reach by pressing the corresponding secret on their phone.</p>
<p>In my study of successful service companies, I have actually seen the financing system take four standard types. Our Audio Conferencing service meets the needs of companies from home-based businesses to big corporations.
